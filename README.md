A Hospital Management System is designed to streamline hospital operations by offering features such as appointment booking, cancellation, and slot availability checking. Patients can easily book or cancel appointments through the system, ensuring a hassle-free experience. The system also allows users to check the availability of appointment slots in real-time, helping them find convenient times for their visits.

Additionally, the system provides a personal dashboard where patients can view and update their personal details. This centralized access to personal and medical information enhances the overall patient experience and facilitates better communication between the hospital and its patients. The Hospital Management System thus improves efficiency, reduces administrative burden, and ensures high-quality patient care.
